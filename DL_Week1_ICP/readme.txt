    Features: Using the basic tensorflow operations in Pyhton
    Configuration: Windows 10, Eclipse, Python 3
    Input/output: Only text output at code excution
    Explain the implementation: The code is explained with comments
    Explain about the deployment: Initializing the matrix variables to calculate the formula (a^2+b)*c. 
	For simplicity, applying this formula in three operations and then assemble them and finally 
	extract the required value by running the session
    limitation: None for this simple task
