Objective: 
Being familiar with the basic functions and tools of Python by solving simple text processing problems. Such as indexing a string, converting a string to a list separate words, searching and testing some conditions. So, we went through four different tasks.
The objective for each task:
1-	Creating a password validation tool: This tool must check whether the password satisfies specific conditions which is very important and popular requirement when selecting a password to ensure it is a strong one and it is hard to compromise. This task gave an opportunity to use if statement and how to test if a string contains one of s group of characters.
2-	Identifying the middle word and the longest word in a string and reversing a string: This task focuses on how to index a string by converting it to a list of words. Here we are dealing with lists and how to access specific element in the list using its position. Other thing is how to iterate within a string in both straight and reverse ways.
3-	Finding the zero sum for three elements within a list of numbers. This is more like an algorithms problem as we have to iterate this numbers list almost three times to keep testing combinations of three numbers. This task gives about sequential iteration within in specific pattern i.e. selecting two numbers from the list each time and adding it to a third number from the same list and test whether the result equals zero. This application can be useful in many cases like load balancing problems and monitoring a system if its values accedes specific level or margin.
4-	Searching for common names in two different names lists: Here the program is looking for the common names in two classes enrolment lists. Such application is popular and important such as the one needed in final exams scheduling or task assigning where we need to avoid time or task conflict. The program is using loops to iterate through the loops and the if statement to test the matching possibility.


Features:
The accomplished programs have been written in a simple programming structure and considering the logic sequence in results processing and proper transitioning between the steps. It is considered that when someone else reads the program to understand its commands line by line and or blocks functionality, by clearly separating the tasks and giving descriptive names for the variables and providing descriptive comments for the main parts of the code.


Configuration:
Similar working configuration had been used for all the Lab1 requirements, they are:
Python 3.6
OS: Widows 10
IDE: Eclipse
