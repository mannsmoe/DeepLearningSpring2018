    Objective: Applying Reinforcement Learning on some of Gym package games (Cart Pole V1 and Mountain Car V0)
    Features: Using the keras as the main deep learning package in Pyhton
    Configuration: Windows 10, Eclipse, Python 3
    Input/output: Text output to show the enhancement of the score while running the games with the RL at code excution. 
	Also, Gym package providing a basic animation illustration for each game to show the game execution progress during each epoch.
    Explain the implementation: The code is explained with comments
    Explain about the deployment: Identifying the number of times to run the game and learn from it. Then, specifying the Agent characteristics.
	Next, identifying the model layers using dense object of keras. Finally, setting and identifying the game running model.
    limitation: Long time for smaller learning rate and higher number of game trial.
